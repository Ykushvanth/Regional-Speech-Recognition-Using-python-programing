The code  works in the following :

This program utilizes the tkinter library for creating a simple GUI (Graphical User Interface) and the speech_recognition library for recognizing speech input. Upon clicking the "Record" button, the program prompts the user to speak and then captures the audio input from the microphone. Afterward, it attempts to recognize the speech using Google's speech recognition API for multiple languages (English (Indian), Tamil (Indian), and Telugu (Indian)). Finally, it displays the recognized speech along with the detected language in a label on the GUI. If no speech is detected or recognized, it prompts the user with a warning message.
